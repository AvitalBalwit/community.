# Welcome to Democracy Earth's Ambassadors Program!

We need your help to bring our message to all four corners of the world ðŸŒŽ, and create a global movement that will redefine what democracy is in the 21st century! 

As an Ambassador, help us spread ðŸ“£ ideas of [Liquid Democracy](https://words.democracy.earth/frozen-in-the-past-no-more-the-promise-of-liquid-democracy-e2a067be18bc) into your home town, and find others that can do so as well. We need Ambassadors in every city, and in every country! We want you to help us start Democracy Earth meetups in your local city, so we can bring the community and kick start the debate about what kind of democracy do we want in the internet age! [Sovereign](https://vote.democracy.earth/) is in alpha, and still under development, but we need to bring in the decision makers: those organizations, collectives and institutions that can significantly benefit by implementing liquid democracy practices in their own governance! 

We will give you resources to help you carry the message and implement our work: videos and slides so you can make presentations in all kinds of events, in the name of Democracy Earth, and also technical information of how to implement sovereign in a local server so your local groups can start using it! You can find all of our source code [here on Github](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign), and engage with us - both on [Github's issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues) and [Slack](http://chat.democracy.earth/) - discussing our paper, [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper), where we are debating liquid democracy with collaborators from all over the world! We have also created a channel on Slack called #ambassadors, where you will be able to connect with all the Ambassadors, share and learn from each other experiences!

As an ambassador of Democracy.Earth you will represent the Democracy Earth Foundation vision of a borderless, post-nation state world, its mission to put the tools of liquid democracy in the hands of every self-sovereign global citizen of the world, and our values of being open source, transparent, accountable, and decentralized. This is a guideline we have put together with all the information you need to get started!
