## A message from Santiago Siri & the DEF Team




**Hello future Ambassador!** We need your help to bring the Democracy.Earth message to the four corners of the world 🌎 and create a global movement that will redefine democracy for the 21st century! 

As an Ambassador, you will help us spread 📣 ideas of [Liquid Democracy](https://words.democracy.earth/frozen-in-the-past-no-more-the-promise-of-liquid-democracy-e2a067be18bc) into your hometown and start Democracy Earth meetups, so we can bring the community in and kickstart a debate about what kind of democracy we want in the internet age!

Our platform [Sovereign](https://vote.democracy.earth/) is in alpha, and still under development. Now, it's time to bring in the decision makers: those organizations, collectives and institutions that can significantly benefit by implementing liquid democracy practices in their own governance.  

That's where you, our Ambassadors, come in. 

Our belief in democracy means we believe that human collaboration is the best possible way to arrive at great solutions, therefore we use Github and document our work as open source projects where anyone is free to contribute. Democracy is always a work in progress, and so is our work: we encourage you to take an active role in building it with us, making suggestions and creating debates.

We will give you resources to help you carry the message and implement our work: videos and slides so you can make presentations in the name of Democracy Earth, and also technical information on how to implement our Sovereign software on a local server so your local group(s) can start using it! 

You can find all of our source code [here on Github](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign), and engage with us - both on [Github's issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues) and [Slack](http://chat.democracy.earth/) - discussing our paper, [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper), where we are debating the components of liquid democracy with collaborators from all over the world! We have also created a channel on Slack called [#ambassadors_def](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/ambassadors_def/), where you will be able to connect with the current Democracy Earth Ambassadors, and share and learn from each other's experiences.

As an Ambassador of Democracy Earth you will represent the Democracy Earth Foundation vision of a borderless, post-nation state world, our mission to put the tools of liquid democracy in the hands of every self-sovereign global citizen of the world, and our values of being open source, transparent, accountable, and decentralized. It is fundamental that you embody our open-source values, welcoming everyone into our collaborative work as co-creators of the future of democracy. **This is a guideline we have put together with all the information you need to get started!**


# Program Overview

<a name="Step-1"></a>

* **Share your vision with the world!** Send us a < 2 minute video to **ambassadors@democracy.earth** sharing what is your inspiration, why these ideas matter to you and your country, and what you would like to accomplish as an Ambassador for Democracy Earth. Make sure to say your name, country, city and contact information so others from your area can connect with you. Our goal is to create a videowall of Ambassadors representing the global scale and the excitement around the movement we are creating. Most importantly, we want to show other people **why these ideas matter,** why they are relevant, and why they should learn about them as well. In your video, consider the world your audience - address the public, the people that you want to engage as a future Ambassador. We have read about you in your application, and now we want you to show your unique vision and voice to the world as well. 

All e-mails should have: **"I want to be an Ambassador for Democracy.Earth"** as a title. Be sure to include a short bio with your full name, where you live (city, country), what is your background and platform, if you have one, and most importantly: why you are inspired to be a Democracy.Earth Ambassador 😊. All videos will go to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbnrw21wKi1T-h26FLUN2ag) to show the world how our movement is growing globally; your video may even be included in the work of documentarians featuring or promoting Democracy.Earth! For inspiration purposes, make sure to check the [amazing work that DEF Ambassador Sunny Sangha is doing in the UK 🇬🇧!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsz7MjMJ5J8)

👉 After following these steps, we will get in touch and schedule a meeting with one of DEF core team members by video conference to discuss your Ambassador application, and your planned strategies and tactics. Steps 2 through 5 

<a name="Step-2"></a>
## **STEP 2 - Connect with Democracy.Earth community channels**

Once you have completed the full application process and have been introduced as an Ambassador, it's time to get acquainted with the wider Democracy.Earth community. 

* Create a personal Github account so we can share with you materials that you can use for presentations! 😊 
* Join the Democracy Earth Ambassadors channel, [#ambassadors_def channel](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/ambassadors_def/) on [Slack](http://chat.democracy.earth/). We communicate with all of our Ambassadors through this channel; as well, it's a great way to get in touch with other ambassadors from around the world doing similar work, learn from them and exchange ideas! Make sure to also search for channels corresponding to your country or community (i.e: [#brasil](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/brasil/), or [#habla_español](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/habla_espanol/) so you can find more people with similar interests in your area!)

## **STEP 3 - Start a community**

* Invite members of your network to the group.
* Connect to the [Democracy Earth Foundation Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/DemocracyEarth/)
* Like, share and comment on Democracy.Earth Fcebook page content in your group feed - get the debate started!😊 
* Share proposals from [vote.democracy.earth](https://vote.democracy.earth/), and get your community engaged in a conversation about liquid democracy and the promise it holds for incorruptible, transparent voting that gives everyone a voice.

<a name="Step-4"></a>
## **STEP 4 - Get the word out**

* Find related democracy/blockchain/civic tech meet-ups, get to know the coordinators, spread the word about Democracy Earth...many Democracy.Earth ambassadors are regular presenters at such events, why not you?
* Reach out to local populations (activists, students, cooperatives) that will benefit from the Sovereign governance platform.
* Write a guest post about your activities for the [Democracy.Earth Medium publication “Hacktivism”](https://words.democracy.earth/).
* Create education materials in your language to spread understanding of the concepts of liquid democracy, decentralization, and crypto politics to your local community.

<a name="Step-5"></a>
## **STEP 5 - Share your experience and help us amplify your voice!**

* For events you are creating or presenting at, share with us any Google Calendar invite to ambassadors@democracy.earth with relevant information (event host, focus, date, venue, presentation title, start time) so that we can share the announcement to Democracy.Earth social media, inviting followers from your area to attend!
* Share your [Learnings, Advice & Experience](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Learning_advice_%26_experiences) here on Github so that other Ambassadors can access it as well!
* Tell us what we can do to help you! The first way to do that is to get the debate started on Slack's [#ambassadors channel](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/ambassadors/) (we will do our best to monitor and engage with all debates), and then after you are sure this is a valuable contribution and have circulated ideas around for a bit, [create a github issue on this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
