# Presentations

Whether you are looking for a step-by-step instructional guide or just tips on on everything from building a presentation or speech that is digital content-ready speech, to planning and implementing an event, be it a MeetUp or Hackathon, the Democracy Earth Community has an expert you can learn from. 

# Guidelines

- Every presentation must be in line with Democracy Earth's aesthetic. 
- The best way to go about it is using one of our templates: 

> **Template 1 (standard presentation):**

PowerPoint

Keynote

Google Slides

> **Template 2 ( geopolitical role of Bitcoin + standard presentation ):**

PowerPoint

Keynote 

Google Slides

- If you want to make a couple tweaks to those templates to better fit your own narrative, ensure that any adittional slide is in accordance with our aesthetic and submit that to us for approval at least a week in advance of your presentation date. 

That includes:

1. Always use the purple background ( Color code: #32263C )
2. Extract design elements such as logo, vote token, etc. from the templates - avoid recreating anything.
2. Use Helvetica as the main font ( see how we use bold / unbold on our template ). 
3. Less is more! :) Make sure every slide contains only the necessary information ( you want people to pay attention to you, and the slide is just a resource that can reinforce your message without being distracting ).
4. Use only **high quality** pictures.
5. If you want to use any other colors, choose the ones that we already use in our templates or the ones from our logo.
