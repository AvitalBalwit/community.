## Democracy Earth Ambassadors Program ðŸŒ¿
# Presentations Support

This file is where we provide links to resources that will help Ambassadors create presentations, social communications and other content. These resources - from presentation slides to audio and video clips - are designed to help ambassadors spread the Democracy Earth message and build a local community around the Democracy Earth mission to enable decentralized, digital governance for the internet age: a borderless, global democracy recognizing the right of every human on earth to have a voice, a vote. 

Check out the [Bibliography](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Bibliography.md#democracy-earth-foundation-) to learn about Democracy Earth's history, public messaging, and communications regarding our vision, mission and goals. And be sure to click the "Watch" button (in the upper right hand corner of this repo file) to get notifications when new resources have been added. 


## Guidelines

While we expect presentations made by Ambassadors should reflect the tone, style and focus you bring to the event, presentation materials themselves should follow the Democracy Earth Branding Guide with respect to usage of logos, color, and graphics ((e.g. use official Democracy Earth purple background color #32263C )). 


**Important: presentations must be reviewed by Democracy Earth Communications at least 72 hours in advance of the event.** Provide the file of you presentation plus a recording of your presentation timing  - we recommend QuickTime.  This also makes for an excellent preparation exercide :)

Additional guidelines for preparing effective presentations include: 

1. Time your presentations in advance; know your overall objective and the key message/takeaway for every slide.
2. Assume one slide per five minutse of presentation time.
3. Extract all graphical design elements such as logo, vote token, liquid democracy illustrations etc. from the Democracy Earth Brand Guide - avoid recreating anything.
4. Use Helvetica as the main font, minimum 24 pt  (see how we use bold / unbold on our template ). 
5. Less is more! Make sure every slide contains only the necessary information ( you want people to pay attention to you, and the slide is just a resource that can reinforce your message without being distracting ).
6. Use only **high quality** pictures.
7. Slide background should be Democracy Earth purple. Choose accent colors from the Democracy Earth Brand Guide.
8. Know before you go: confirm presentation setup in advance with event orgnaizers, and choose your presentation format accordingly.
9. Every presentation should address fundamental messages of the Democracy Earth platform: The Social Smart Contract, the benefits and tools of blockchain-based liquid democracy.  
10. Liquid democracy is not an abstract idea - in vote.democracy.earth you have a toolbox to demonstrate/explore. Every presentation should contain a call to action to log on to vote.democracy.earth.  Plan to engage the audience with pre-prepared polls/proposals/debates or #hashtag issues created on vote.democracy.earth before the event.
11. Where possible, establish with Democracy Earth an api.democracy.earth for your organization/jurisdiction/event.
