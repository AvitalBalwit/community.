## Democracy Earth Foundation ðŸŒ¿
# Presentations

This file is where we will provide links to resources to help Ambassadors create presentations, social communications and other content designed to help you build a local community around the Democracy Earth mission to enable decentralized, digital governance for the internet age - a borderless, global democracy recognizing the right of every human on earth to have a voice, a vote. 

Check out the [Bibliography](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Bibliography.md#democracy-earth-foundation-) to learn about Democracy Earth's history, public messaging, and communications regarding our vision, mission and goals. And be sure to click the "Watch" button (in the upper right hand corner of this repo file) to get notifications when new resources have been added. 


# Guidelines
While we expect presentations made by Ambassadors should reflect the tone, style and focus you bring to the event, presentation materials themselves should follow the Democracy Earth Branding Guide with respect to usage of logos, color, and graphics ((e.g. use official Democracy Earth purple background color #32263C )). Additional guidelnes for effective presenations include: 

1. Extract all graphical design elements such as logo, vote token, liquid democracy illustrations etc. from the Brand Guide - avoid recreating anything
2. Use Helvetica as the main font ( see how we use bold / unbold on our template ). 
3. Less is more! Make sure every slide contains only the necessary information ( you want people to pay attention to you, and the slide is just a resource that can reinforce your message without being distracting ).
4. Use only **high quality** pictures.
5. If you want to use any other colors, choose the ones that we already use in our templates or the ones from our logo following the Brand Guide.
