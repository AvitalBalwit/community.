# Presentations

This file is where we will provide links to resources to help Ambassadors create presentations, social communications and other content. These are designed to help you spread our message and build a local community around the Democracy Earth mission to enable decentralized, digital governance for the internet age: a borderless, global democracy recognizing the right of every human on earth to have a voice, a vote. 

Check out the [Bibliography](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Bibliography.md#democracy-earth-foundation-) to learn about Democracy Earth's history, public messaging, and communications regarding our vision, mission and goals. And be sure to click the "Watch" button (in the upper right hand corner of this repo file) to get notifications when new resources have been added. 


# Guidelines

While we expect presentations made by Ambassadors should reflect the tone, style and focus you bring to the event, presentation materials themselves should follow the Democracy Earth Branding Guide with respect to usage of logos, color, and graphics ((e.g. use official Democracy Earth purple background color #32263C )). 


**All presentations must be sent to sandra@democracy.earth at least 72 hours in advance of the event for approval.** Send the file that you will be utilizing, plus a video of you talking through the slides (you can record yourself speaking while you go through the slides on your screen with Quicktime player). This also makes for an excellent preparation exercide :)

Additional guidelnes for preparing effective presentations include: 

1. Prepare your presentations carefully in advance, with a plan of what you would like to say on each slide. 
2. Extract all graphical design elements such as logo, vote token, liquid democracy illustrations etc. from the Brand Guide - avoid recreating anything.
2. Use Helvetica as the main font ( see how we use bold / unbold on our template ). 
3. Less is more! Make sure every slide contains only the necessary information ( you want people to pay attention to you, and the slide is just a resource that can reinforce your message without being distracting ).
4. Use only **high quality** pictures.
5. If you want to use any other colors, choose the ones that we already use in our templates or the ones from our logo following the Brand Guide.
6. To avoid any issues, ask the organizers of the event what are the dimensions that the file needs to be in so that it properly fits the screen.
7. Always invite your audience to try our platform! Tell them you are not there to speak about an abstract idea, but something that they can actually start using now. In advance of the event, create a post at vote.democracy.earth (or the url corresponding to the jurisdiction / organization where you are at) and include it on your presentation. It's a moment where you can invite everyone to check the platform and vote! Here is an example:
