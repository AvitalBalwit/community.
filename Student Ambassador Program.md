## About<a name="About"></a>

Democracy Earth Foundation is building a global movement for blockchain-based liquid democracy. As we began rolling out our global [Ambassadors program](https://words.democracy.earth/ambassadors/home), it became readily apparent that the light of democracy hacktivism burns bright in the young too, in the hearts of students at universities around the world. This has spurred us to extend our Ambassadors program onto campus, and launch a targeted initiative designed for and by students: the Democracy.Earth Student Ambassador program. 

Globally, universities have proven a natural petri dish for hacking democracy. Universities are rich with micro-activism and decision-making, presenting a low consequence environment for innovative governance experiments. During the Summer of 2018, Democracy Earth Foundation will hold an 8-week peer-learning program with students from all over the globe as part of a training curriculum for future Student Ambassadors focused on fundamental 'learning building blocks' of blockchain technology.   The _**Basics of Blockcahin**_ course of study will lay the basis for an in-depth understanding of implementing a tokenized liquid democracy in a rapidly evolving crypto-political landscape. After completing the program, Student Ambassadors will not only be equipped to advocate for these ideas but will have the tools to begin implementing liquid democracy governance pilots within their universities. 

Our chosen teaching format - a peer-to-peer learning program - is designed to ensure student ambassadors can leverage the expertise of a global network of democracy activist peers. The program will consist of eight weekly meetings in which a range of topics will be covered, including **the history of citizen participation technology (democracy tech), the basics of blockchain technology, applications of smart contracts for governance, the tools and tactics of liquid democracy, the case for global governance and cryptographically distributed universal basic income (UBI), the emerging dynamics of crypto politics, the technical challenges of decentralized IDs and Sybil Attacks, the governance aspects of blockchain networks**, and more.

Student Ambassadors will be challenged to engage their peers on the Democracy Earth governance platform, [vote.democracy.earth](https://vote.democracy.earth/), form a local team, engage a faculty sponsor, publish content and host MeetUps to kickstart their communities and engage organizations and student governments to experiment liquid democracy . 

## Acknowledgements
The _*Basics of Blockchain*_ program curriculum was created in collaboration with our pioneer Student Ambassadors: Robel Mulugueta (Yale University), Travis Bell and Samuel Eisner (UC Berkeley), Charles Thompson (Cornell University), Avital Balwit (University of Virginia) and Robinson Markus (Northwestern University), as well as Janine GÃ¶lz . The content will be hosted online, so that anyone can access it, but the Foundation will facilitate a peer-learning initiative with the goal of connecting students and having them be supported as they learn and work with our platform.

## Program Table of Contents<a name="Content"></a>

**Week 1 | Background**

We start by providing a brief history of citizen-participation technology (democracy tech) and how that history informs the vision for our work at Democracy Earth. We explore what does it mean to build a values-based software, what is open source, why it matters and how it works. 
Challenge: Start creating debates on your universitie's URL and invite your peers to join it!

**Week 2  | Blockchain**

Solid introductory knowledge of the mechanics behind blockchains. Every Ambassador will be able to own the basic "blockchain vocabulary" [public/private keys, the double-spend problem, protocol, hash, timestamps and proof of work].

**Week 3 | Smart contracts & Liquid democracy**

Introductory knowledge of smart contracts and their application for transparency, accountability, governance and participatory budgeting + an in depth view of liquid democracy.

**Week 4 | Global Governance**

We will explore the challenges that our globalized economy and interconnected ecology present for nationally based governments. Here we share DEF's vision for the need of an inclusive global governance system that can be enacted from the individual level, the role that the foundation aims to play in enabling it through a blockchain-based ID software and tokenization of votes + our strategy for deploying it.

**Week 5 | Crypto politics**

Introduction to the geopolitical role of Bitcoin and the emerging dynamics of crypto politics. 
Challenge:	Find a partner / team, to work with them in their respective universities.


**Week 6 | Decentralized ID**

Introduction to the main challenge of the crypto ecossystem: building a truly decentralized ID system. We also share DEF views on the matter and parallel developments from other organizations. 
Challenge:	Find a faculty sponsor. Engage a teacher who might be interested in helping your activities and could be of support.


**Week 7 | Blockchain governance**

Deepening the concepts learned on Week 2, and an overview of the governance issues in the current scenario. 
Challenge: 	Redact article to be published in a university newspaper or another publication.

**Week 8  | Operating in a network**

Orientation for how to join and participate in the network, how to keep Foundation updated on events and how to ask for help.
Challenge: 	Organize a meetup.
