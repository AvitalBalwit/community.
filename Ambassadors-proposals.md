# Ambassadors proposals



As an Ambassador for Democracy Earth Foundation ðŸŒŽ, there are many different avenues of work that you can take: 

You may be planning to put yourself as a liquid democracy candidate in your jurisdiction, start a politicat party, utilize
Sovereign to empower existing processes of civic participation, or even to promote one specific cause. The possibilities are as big as the 
number of Ambassadors. In this file, we will be sharing different formats of strategic plans designed by our Ambassadors, so they can serve
as a reference for new applicants and the community!


## #1 Democracy.Earth - Brooklyn Embassy

Democracy.Earth is a Blockchain Based civic Technology focused on implementing Blockchain empowered Liquid Democracy from a bottom-up 
approach. They are in Beta and are looking to support local piloting in Brooklyn & broader NYC.


This proposal refers to a Brooklyn Embassy - we are beginning discussions on what sort of plan would be needed to implement a pilot program
locally, something through sustained engagement, and impact.

In short - the pilot, is a beta Blockchain based technology that would support the local governance process by bringing Digital 
constituents to the conversation (which is primarily physically based), and also implementing a new process that allows for empowered 
consituents to decide how engaged they would love to be in the governance process (from Passive (Representative) to Active(Direct)).

Mission & Values (Increase access to the local governance process, and empower the individual to determine how engaged they are in the 
local governance process (from Passive (strictly representative) to Active (direct vote))

**Proposed Plan Year 1**

Determine # of Volunteer Engagement - structure plan of action from this. 

Roles - all similar the first year, there are 59 community districts, perhaps 1 per district (as allowing) with each role to focus on:

* Understand current governance process within district - communicate process end to end, strengths, pain points, demographics of the 
constituents, communicate effectiveness (subjective). This would need extensive research in district outside of the community attendance to understand (gaps btw engaged citizens & full constituents: age, ethnicity, nationality, income, type of work, etc.)
* Build Relationships with Stakeholders - District members, council members, engaged community members (businesses, nonprofits, etc.)
* Plant seeds on the concept of Liquid Democracy - this would involve conversations, organized events & speaking at such events etc.
* Support Development of Sovereign - this would involve engagement with the platform, and support through business requirements as learned from in the community centers etc.

**Proposed Plan Year 2**

* Future State Alignment - among community members, align against future state with Sovereign implemented.
* Gap Analysis - Structure lessons learned from Year 1 and discuss what is needed to implement this technology in the long term. This would involve community meetings & deliverables to structure the lessons learned
* Grow Seeds planted year before - have conversations with stakeholders to further understand what may be needed to implement - partnerships, financing, etc.
* Develop Plans & Socialize for Strong Community Buy in

**Proposed Plan Year 3**
Implement Plans from Year 2
