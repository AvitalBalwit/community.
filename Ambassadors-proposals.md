# Ambassadors proposals



As an Ambassador for Democracy Earth Foundation ðŸŒŽ, there are many different avenues of work that you can take: 

You may be planning to put yourself as a liquid democracy candidate in your jurisdiction, start a politicat party, utilize
Sovereign to empower existing processes of civic participation, or even to promote one specific cause. The possibilities are as big as the 
number of Ambassadors. In this file, we will be sharing different formats of strategic plans designed by our Ambassadors, so they can serve
as a reference for new applicants and the community!


## #1 Democracy.Earth - Brooklyn Embassy

Democracy.Earth is a Blockchain Based civic Technology focused on implementing Blockchain empowered Liquid Democracy from a bottom-up 
approach. They are in Beta and are looking to support local piloting in Brooklyn & broader NYC.


This proposal refers to a Brooklyn Embassy - we are beginning discussions on what sort of plan would be needed to implement a pilot program
locally, something through sustained engagement, and impact.

In short - the pilot, is a beta Blockchain based technology that would support the local governance process by bringing Digital 
constituents to the conversation (which is primarily physically based), and also implementing a new process that allows for empowered 
consituents to decide how engaged they would love to be in the governance process (from Passive (Representative) to Active(Direct)).

Mission & Values (Increase access to the local governance process, and empower the individual to determine how engaged they are in the 
local governance process (from Passive (strictly representative) to Active (direct vote))

**Proposed Plan Year 1**

Determine # of Volunteer Engagement - structure plan of action from this. 

Roles - all similar the first year, there are 59 community districts, perhaps 1 per district (as allowing) with each role to focus on:

* Understand current governance process within district - communicate process end to end, strengths, pain points, demographics of the 
constituents, communicate effectiveness (subjective). This would need extensive research in district outside of the community attendance to understand (gaps btw engaged citizens & full constituents: age, ethnicity, nationality, income, type of work, etc.)
* Build Relationships with Stakeholders - District members, council members, engaged community members (businesses, nonprofits, etc.)
* Plant seeds on the concept of Liquid Democracy - this would involve conversations, organized events & speaking at such events etc.
* Support Development of Sovereign - this would involve engagement with the platform, and support through business requirements as learned from in the community centers etc.

**Proposed Plan Year 2**

* Future State Alignment - among community members, align against future state with Sovereign implemented.
* Gap Analysis - Structure lessons learned from Year 1 and discuss what is needed to implement this technology in the long term. This would involve community meetings & deliverables to structure the lessons learned
* Grow Seeds planted year before - have conversations with stakeholders to further understand what may be needed to implement - partnerships, financing, etc.
* Develop Plans & Socialize for Strong Community Buy in

**Proposed Plan Year 3**
Implement Plans from Year 2



## #1 Democracy.Earth - Chicago Embassy

By: Hannah Wolfman-Jones, ambassador applicant

The thing that excites me so about Democracy Earth, as well as the broader decentralize-everything
movement inspired by the blockchain, is that it dramatically expands the horizon of what is possible for
organizing governments and societies. During this potentially transformative period in civilization, early
engagement of people with a broad range of perspectives and expertise need to join the discussion to
capture our collective intelligence and build consensus.

Shifting American society from our current broken government to a more open, transparent, and
collaborative form or governance and from corporate-controlled digital identities to individual-controlled
identities is no small task. Discussion, research, development of alternatives, and pilots are required to
fine tune the solutions provided by Sovereign to unique needs. A drastic overhaul of the government will
not and should not occur overnight. Instead, Sovereign should be applied in limited discreet applications
at first to increase stakeholder familiarity and comfort with the technology and concepts.

Here in Chicago, I want to get the conversation started on Liquid Democracy and other applications of
Sovereign. Chicago is well positioned to spawn a community of thought leaders and experimenters in
applying the blockchain to new modes of governance as there is a rapidly growing contingency of
businesses, local government departments, and individuals interested in cryptocurrency and the
blockchain. In fact, the Illinois Department of Commerce is piloting five different use cases for
blockchain. They completed a pilot of using Sovereign to simplify the property title process with great
success and may pursue it further. Chicago is also home to the only two companies trading Bitcoin futures
and a host of blockchain startups and projects.

**Stage 1**

**1.** Introduce the concept of blockchain voting, Liquid Democracy, decentralization, and individually-
controlled digital identities

-speaking engagements and conversations at blockchain/ government events and meetups
-clubs at colleges/universities
-publish content discussing Democracy Earth and related concepts

**2.** Perform research on the best ways to introduce the concepts of Democracy Earth and develop a
strategy guide. Many people's reaction to such unfamiliar and revolutionary ideas is fear, anger, and
disengagement. The introduction of Democracy Earth to stakeholders needs to account for their existing
views and needs.

**3.** Support development of Sovereign by building the encouraging community engagement on Github,
etc.. Convey to interested parties that their ideas, even when not fully aligned with the existing
whitepaper, are valuable and their input is beneficial.

**4.** Host local salon-style events that use the Socratic or other method to stimulate critical-thinking and
discussion among participants about the concepts of Democracy Earth.

**5.** Identify local organizations who may pilot all or part of Sovereign and work with them to get one
started. Of particular interest are the city government of Chicago and student governments at Universities.
Compile data and lessons learned from all pilots. Iterate on Sovereign, or implementations of Sovereign
from those lessons and pilot again. Develop a plan for compiling a body of research and conducting
adequate testing that will be required for Sovereign to be considered for larger-scale implementations.

**6.** Start a Democracy Earth University Ambassador program to bring Sovereign and Liquid Democracy to
college campuses. This would be particularly constructive for Democracy Earth because: (1) universities
are great hotbeds for low-consequence experimentation, (2) this would reach a large population of people
who grew up online, are looking to immerse themselves in new ideas, will be leaders in the governments
and societies of tomorrow, and are known for their energy and enthusiasm.

**7.** Lobby current politicians to incorporate aspects of Democracy Earth's vision. For a start, this lobbying
would focus on encouraging the government to implement: 1. secure voting using Sovereign
(transitioning to liquid democracy is far down the road), 2. direct polls of citizens for a variety of issues
using Sovereign, and 3. managing property deeds, birth certificates, car registrations, and other legal
documents on Sovereign.

**Stage 2** 

1. Identify a political candidate for the City of Chicago and build their campaign.
