# Introduction

The Democracy Earth Foundation is working to update government for the 21st century by building a blockchain-based liquid-democracy platform. In that pursuit, the foundation has spent the past 6 years researching, experimenting, learning and building at the intersection of technology and politics. In our white paper, [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/blob/master/README.mediawiki), we explore in detail how a blockchain-based liquid democracy can help the world solve some of the most pressing challenges facing democracy, such as rising authoritarianism and a lack of voter participation.

While Democracy Earth is focused on building civic tech designed to be easy to use on an everyday basis, we also view it as important to provide education regarding the ideas and technology that have made this possible. Due to the fact that The Social Smart Contract contains some technical vocabulary and information that require background expertise not possessed by the typical reader, we are launching this companion curriculum, the Democracy Academy. Our goal is to give readers the foundational knowledge needed to understand the content of The Social Smart Contract, provide a sound understanding of blockchains, liquid democracy and other technical information it contains, and with it help foster a global movement that enables everyone to claim civic participation as their right.


The content of Democracy Academy was developed collaboratively by students for students, but will be helpful to anyone curious about these topics. Our goal is for everyone following this curriculum to emerge with a strong grasp of essential blockchain technology concepts, as well as the history and context around the founding and development of the Democracy Earth governance platform. It is our hope that in doing so we can help a new generation of leaders effectively learn as much as possible about the intersection of technology and politics - and Democracy Earth‚Äôs crowd-sourced proposal - so they are fully equipped to advocate for it, contribute to it, and promote it around the world.

Neither the white paper nor the Democracy Academy curriculum are intended to remain static and we welcome contributions from readers to continue improving them. Like Democracy itself, Democracy Academy must always be a work in progress.

# 1.0 Background

In Week One, we discuss the emergence of civic tech/democracy tech and the history of the Democracy Earth Foundation. We will provide an overview of the vision and journey of Democracy Earth founders, and how their experiences and lessons shape our software development and movement.

##  1.1 A group of hacktivists tried to improve their country

Before co-founders Pia Mancini and Santiago Siri launched Democracy Earth and the Sovereign platform, they created a software called Democracy OS, one of the earliest civic tech projects of its kind. As Pia stated in a 2016 interview with The Guardian [1], Democracy OS could not have emerged in a stable country like the US or UK, but only in a country where politics were bad enough that people were willing to take risks. In many ways, their native Argentina - with some of the highest internet access in Latin America, yet some of the most corrupt and unresponsive politics - offered the perfect birthplace for this historic civic tech. 

Pia's political education included years spent developing training programs to teach democratic values, preparing civil leaders for public office - efforts that were succcessful in getting candidates elected as mayors and governonrs. Yet systemic corruption made it clear that working in traditional politics would not be effective in fixing pervasive social issues. Eventually Pia and Santi concluded that it was not enough to try to place better people in the same system, but that the very system itself was an issue. It distanced the voters from decision-making, creating a breakdown in communication between political leaders and ordinary citizens. That inspired them to create Democracy OS, where citizens could learn about current congressional policy proposals, as well as make their own proposals, debate and vote on them. The software translated all proposals into plain language, and was accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Though Pia, Santi and their collaborators offered the Democracy OS platform to political parties, they had no takers; instead, they were "sent away like little kids", as she noted in her [2014 TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/pia_mancini_how_to_upgrade_democracy_for_the_internet_era). 

They were not the first civic technologists to learn the lesson that software alone could not solve the deep divide between politicians and citizens ‚Äì although better technology was needed, the main barrier was still a cultural one. Undaunted by this rejection, Pia and Santi decided to take a different path, and form their own political party called  ‚ÄúPartido de la Red,‚Äù or the ‚ÄúNet Party‚Äù in English. The party promised to vote in line with how citizens voted on the DemocracyOS application. In 2013, they campaigned with a large Trojan Horse made of wood, driving it around the neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires. The Trojan Horse signified that while the Net Party was participating in the familiar process of campaigning like a typical political party, it was only a front - they had no intention to behave like one. Unlike the other parties, they intended to actually let citizens guide their decisions directly through their app. While Partido de la Red candidates did not win an elected seat in the parliament, they received 22,000 votes. It was enough for the Congress to take notice and to launch an instance of DemocracyOS to discuss three issues, two on public transport and one on the use of public space.

Partido de la Red and DemocracyOS taught Pia and Santi three important lessons that still ring true today:

1. Civic tech has the potential to revolutionize government. Though it failed to gain a Parliamentary seat, Partido de la Red forced the government to take notice of, and even use, Democracy OS civic tech. Clearly, the idea of online participation had power - it resonated with people. But even with this success, the government did not promise to vote in alignment with the decisions made by citizens on the Democracy OS platform, which led to the second lesson:

2.  While civic tech has a true potential to change government, this change is far from inevitable -  and a simple app that serves as an interface with Congress is not enough in and of itself to make change happen.

3. The third and most painful lesson was about corruption. [Spies infiltrated party meetings](https://medium.com/@santisiri/baptism-of-fire-100392b05726) to generate confusion; they were attacked online, and were even asked to bribe a judge in order to be able to run for the 2015 elections. This first-hand contact with corruption taught them how difficult it is to change the system from within. As Santi has remarked, ‚Äúit is much more likely that the system will change you first.‚Äù

## 1.2 Silicon Valley

In 2015 the Silicon Valley accelerator YCombinator - backer of Reddit and AirBnb, among others - invited Pia and Santi to join the Y15 class of nonprofit startups, selected for their potential for global impact. It was here they met Herb Stephens, a former GE auditor and serial software entrepreneur with a 25-year history of building disintermediating systems that shifted power to the user through technology. Since learning of blockchain technology in 2012 and considering it ‚Äúthe best invention since the Internet itself‚Äù, Herb dedicated the rest of his career to social entrepreneurism, readily joining the foundation in the role of president and treasurer.

Together Herb, Santi, Pia and Virgile Devile - the Paris-based co-founder of Open Source Politics and one-time team lead for Democracy OS Europe- formed the Democracy Earth Foundation, a U.S. (CA) 501¬©(3) non-profit.

With these early civic tech experiences, the team was prepared to go well beyond the constraints of the political status quo. They adopted a theory of change best summarized by architect Buckminster Fullers‚Äô famous quote: **‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt change the existing reality by fighting against it. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.‚Äù** In other words, building an app to interface with existing political systems won‚Äôt create change; what is needed is a tool that brings about such an obvious and enormous improvement to governance it renders the current system outdated.

Their new approach was to use blockchains - the same technology underlying Bitcoin - to create a censorship resistant peer-to-peer democracy (terms that will be explained in greater detail later in the curriculum). This new focus would bring massive improvements to three fundamental pillars of governance: 

**Voting**: The current system for voting is both insecure and difficult to audit because it is highly centralized. It can be hacked and manipulated in many ways, and the only people able to verify voting rolls are a very small group of election officials. With a blockchain-based system, manipulating results is functionally impossible as all votes are recorded in an immutable public ledger that anyone can audit.

**Identity**: Today we receive identity from centralized authorities such as governments providing passports and ID cards, and from websites providing passwords, logins and profiles. The Democracy Earth platform will employ a decentralized ID system, allowing citizens to have a secure form of identification beyond the influence of any third party. Democracy Earth will help citizens own their data and identity through the use of new cryptographic technologies, which will be explained in-depth later in the curriculum.

**Representation**: Our system does not provide the right incentives for our representatives to represent us very well. If we disagree with how they voted, we have to wait until the next election cycle to try to remove them which could be many years. We are forced to choose a single representative to represent us on all issues, rather than be able to choose multiple experts from different fields to represent us on different issues. This is why Democracy Earth is building a liquid democracy platform that allows for users to propose, debate, and vote directly on issues, or to *delegate* their vote to someone they trust to vote for them. Representation will be more responsive when you can delegate your vote to anyone and immediately revoke it if they vote incorrectly or behave unethically.

## 1.3 Sovereign

There are three main strategic components to the Democracy Earth governance platform, Sovereign: it is blockchain based, open source, and designed to be as simple to use as a social media platform.

**Why blockchain and not just an online platform?** 

In the next section we will learn exactly how a blockchain works to store information in an incorruptible way. Until then, what is important to know now is that blockchain technology is necessary for security and censorship resistance. In order for election results to be trusted on this platform, it has to be blockchain-based, so that all users are able to see that votes have been tallied accurately. 

Web-based voting platforms are centrally run. They have one organization that manages the platform, and this centralization makes it easier to tamper with or even shut them down. Blockchain based platforms are decentralized and maintained by nodes ‚Äì essentially people running a program on their computer ‚Äì making them much harder to shut down. Alternative governance platforms like Democracy Earth are most necessary where  governments are repressive, where transparency is nonexistent and where voters face the greatest threat of censorship. By using blockchain technology, the Sovereign platform is resistant to both hacking and censorship.

**Why must the platform be open source?** 

Open source describes software with source code that anyone can freely inspect or use. Another property of open source is that anyone is able to contribute code, so it is a truly open and transparent process of creation. For Democracy Earth, the open source ethos extends beyond code, carrying into decision-making too. For example, topics concerning the platform are regularly debated on the Democracy Earth Github [repository](code.democracy.earth). Even our white paper The Social Smart Contract was created in open source, with contributors adding to it from around the world.

**Why a ‚Äúsocial media feel‚Äù?**

Good civic tech needs to be something people will want to use everyday. Although people should be encouraged to participate in their own governance, too often are actively shut out by densely written, legalistic policy language or by practices that are difficult to understand without a political science or law degree.  At Democracy Earth we aim for the exact opposite ‚Äì to use clear, simple, everyday language and an easy, user-friendly interface that allows anyone to propose a topic of discussion, vote, or delegate their votes to someone else to vote on their behalf. People can use the app for other types of organizing - not only for political decision-making but for day-to-day uses, like deciding on a weekend gathering or what kind of food they want at their office. It is a design enabling simple governance that is inclusive and as easy as clicking ‚Äúlike‚Äù.

While Democracy Earth will have a social media look and feel, other features will vary widely relative to typical social media platforms. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms, actions taken on on Sovereign will not be aggregated and sold to advertisers. Users will not be put into ideological boxes where they are limited to viewing topics and votes that they agree with. Right now, users are the *products* of most social media platforms: most do not realize to what degree their information is being sold to researchers and advertisers, or to what degree their consumer, political, and cultural preferences are being manipulated. With the revelations of how user data were improperly shared during the 2016 US election by data consultants Cambridge Analytica -  enabling its clients to influence the outcome through targeted campaign advertising -  it is clear that data ownership is a critical issue for protecting free thinking and democracies. With Democracy Earth, it will be impossible to collect data to manipulate users, enabling it to become a forum for true discussion and decision-making rather than an algorithmically curated echo chamber.

Our mission at Democracy Earth is to create a governance platform with all the good qualities of social media ‚Äì the accessibility, usability, the global facilitation of discussion and the sharing of stories. Given the decentralized nature of blockchains, there will be no governing body with the ability to collect data or manipulate feeds; Sovereign would not be able to mirror any of social media‚Äôs negative aspects. Most importantly, users will own their data, meaning they cannot be exposed to the kinds of psychological manipulation enabled by centralized applications like Facebook.

Another key difference from centralized social media: while a ‚Äúlike‚Äù or a ‚Äúretweet‚Äù on centralized platforms might show support for a person or idea, in practical terms these signals serve the purpose of feeding attention-mining algorithms that generate profit to the private organizations controlling the apps. With Sovereign, because there is no middleman, all benefits from the use of the platform go to the users. They keep their data, they make meaningful decisions about their own lives.

Ultimately, Sovereign will help realize the principles expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

*‚ÄúEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.‚Äù*

# 2.0 Blockchain Basics

In this section we will learn about the technology and history behind blockchains, in order to understand how blockchain networks provide censorship resistance and security for the Democracy Earth platform.

## 2.1 Origins of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.
### "Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.‚Äù
Eric Hughes | *The Cypherpunk Manifesto*

Bitcoin and blockchains are products of a particular intellectual ecosystem, one that arose from a series of technological innovations and far-seeing individuals. Though these seem like new innovations, in fact the fundamental cryptographic technologies underlying the Bitcoin blockchain were created in response to a collection of important political and mathematical developments in the second half of the twentieth century.

Throughout World War II, the Allied and Axis powers secretly developed systems of mathematic codes and ciphers to relay sensitive wartime information between field commanders and their superiors. Only those who possessed the proper key could read the information ‚Äì so the key was only shared between the two parties communicating. These messages were sometimes called cryptographs. Some of the Allied nations - namely the U.S. and Britain - created their own ways of using cryptography (the codes and ciphers) to securely send messages.

However, these nations also needed to pioneer ways of decrypting the cryptographs sent by their enemies (Germany and Japan) without knowing the keys. This process is called cryptanalysis. Several major battles were won by the Allies through the efforts of early cryptanalysts who worked tirelessly and in complete anonymity from the public to crack the ciphers used by the Axis powers - the most renowned one being Alan Turing for his breakthrough accomplishments in the field.


![10926282_827780993955768_6579335784379262103_o](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40152411/41207409-69abcc16-6cca-11e8-9e51-40a4f7391a9c.jpg)
 
 At the end of the war, military shifted its focus to the maintenance of national security. The Cold War political climate ushered in an era of information warfare and espionage between the United States and Russia. This led the United States executive branch to leverage the powers of Congress to allow the FBI and other intelligence agencies to use wiretaps and digital surveillance methods on U.S. citizens. Around the same time, [two publications](https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/heritage/ModSec.htm), the US Government Publication of the *Data Encryption Standard* and Dr. Martin Hellman‚Äôs *New Directions in Cryptography*, demonstrated the value of cryptography for secure data communication. More importantly, these publications revealed new forms of cryptographic technologies that otherwise would not have been available for use by the general public. 

In fact, Dr. Hellman‚Äôs writing on ‚Äúpublic-key cryptography,‚Äù also known as asymmetric cryptography, was the first of its kind, and later inspired the work of individuals such as Eric Hughes. In 1992, Eric Hughes, Timothy May, and John Gilmore founded a small group of mathematically savvy firebrands to share ideas about increasing individual privacy through the use of cryptography. Jude Milhon, an attendee of the first group meeting, was credited with naming the group ‚ÄúCypherpunks‚Äù, a clever combination of cipher and cyberpunk. More like-minded individuals began to attend the group‚Äôs meetings and this free flowing sharing of thoughts eventually culminated into Eric Hughes‚Äô  [*A Cypherpunk's Manifesto*](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html).


![dxtedfax0aa_-at](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40152411/41207401-484bcc06-6cca-11e8-991c-7e4c274f8641.jpg =500x400)

The document outlined the beliefs and vision of the Cypherpunk movement. Hughes explained the distinction between privacy and secrecy throughout the manifesto, famously writing that 

***"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.‚Äù***

Yet perhaps the most powerful message of the manifesto was that in order for society to successfully enter into the electronic era, it would be necessary to increase individual privacy. The Cypherpunk movement and its vision of an electronic era that guaranteed the human right to privacy has inspired generations of new dreamers to continue using cryptography in pioneering ways. Blockchain technology was one of these ways. Throughout the next sections of this unit we will explore the various components that were combined to create the Bitcoin network. 

## 2.2 Peer-to-peer networks
### ‚ÄúA purely  peer-to-peer   version   of  electronic  cash  would  allow  online payments  to be sent  directly from one party to another without  going through a financial institution.‚Äù 
Satoshi Nakamoto | [*Excerpt from Bitcoin Whitepaper*](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Bitcoin, and the underlying blockchain technology, was created by an anonymous individual or group called "Satoshi Nakamoto." Satoshi wanted to create a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash." **Peer-to-peer** basically means person-to-person or without intermediaries. In other words, no intermediaries. It's a term used to describe a network in which participants can communicate with each other *directly*, without the need for centralized **[trusted third parties](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/verif.pdf)** (TTPs) to intermediate the exchange of services or the transfer of data.  Peer-to-peer networks are becoming a staple of the 21st century ‚Äúsharing economy‚Äù business model. Uber and AirBnB are partial examples of a peer-to-peer because while the services are provided in a peer-to-peer manner the payment and governance still happens through a centralized company. The bitcoin blockchain is an example of a truly peer-to-peer network. 

## 2.3 How can a truly peer-to-peer Internet of Value be enabled?  What is the double-spend dilemma?

### ‚ÄúWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.‚Äù
Satoshi Nakamoto | *Excerpt from Bitcoin Whitepaper* 

A peer-to-peer network in the physical world is slightly simpler to create, where individuals can directly exchange cars, rent their rooms, or trade services. But Satoshi was not trying to create any sort of physical peer-to-peer network; instead, his goal was a completely digital network where individuals could send money to each other. In the physical world, someone either hands you cash or they do not. In contrast, a digital exchange of digital money creates a host of issues, not least of them requiring trusted organizations ‚Äì usually banks ‚Äì to serve as intermediaries. Creating a peer-to-peer network that can operate without the need for centralized intermediaries is the first step towards democratizing the way we share data. It also happens to be a difficult task because this network must be able to communicate valuable data (such as money, or votes) **without allowing it to be replicated**. How to create such a network had baffled the worlds best cryptographers and cypherpunks until the release of the bitcoin whitepaper in 2008.


#### 2.3.1 The Double-Spend Dilemma:

This brings us to the difference between the internet of information and the internet of value. The **internet of information** contains websites and digital communication protocols that allow for the sharing of materials such as emails, photos, or documents. Right now on the internet of information, when you want to send some piece of information you are not sending the original but rather a duplicate (copy) of the data.  The sender of information still retains the original photo or document when a message or email is sent. **The internet of value** deals with the sending of a different class of things -- things that have value due to their scarcity such as a vote, intellectual property, or money.  In these type of transfers of valuable digital items it is crucial that the sender relinquish ownership of the data - this is the concept of [*digital scarcity*](https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/5/24/17390778/cryptokitties-blockchain-explainer). The sender must send the original and not a copy - this is so that the original sender cannot use the same valuable data to make the same transfer to a new party -- a practice known as "double spending." In the Bitcoin whitepaper Satoshi Nakamoto explains a solution to this double spend dilemma -- one that used peer-to-peer networks -- as well as several other technical elements that we explain below.


## 2.4 What is a hash function and why are hashes important in peer-to-peer networks?

#### 2.4.1 Hash & Hash Function
A **[hash function](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/what-are-hash-functions)** is a mathematical process that takes any kind of digital message and turns it into a unique sequence of letters and numbers *that always has a fixed amount of characters*. For example, it could take my digital image of an apple and turn it into 256 bits. It would also take something much longer and more complex -  say, the draft of a novel - and turn it into a different 256 bits. It can be thought of as a mathematical operation that transforms any input of arbitrary data into a fixed-length numerical value. This numerical value is called a **Hash**.  This hash value is represented by a string of characters that includes numbers and letters.  The Hash can be described as a **digital fingerprint** that is unique to a single input of value. No input can have more than one unique hash, and no hash can refer to more than one unique input. If there is any change in the value of the input then *the hash itself must change completely*. Adding a leaf to our earlier example of digital image of an apple would result in a completely new and different hash. Hence the term digital ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù - no two hashes (of different input data) are ever alike.

So what is the purpose of utilizing hash functions in a blockchain network? As described above, hash functions will only return a single unique output given the same input.  If there is any change to the message being hashed, then the hash of the message changes completely.  This fundamental property of hash functions is exactly what blockchain networks leverage to make the ledger **immutable**. On the bitcoin network, people make transactions -- essentially sending bitcoin to each other in exchange for some good or service. Groups of transactions (called **blocks**) are periodically (for the Bitcoin blockchain, every ten minutes) pooled together and all of the data that comprise each transaction are combined and hashed.  When the new block of transactions is ready, the hash of the previous block is included as part of the transaction data to be hashed for this new block.  This creates a chain of hashes, meaning all of the transactions that come before a new block are inextricably linked to the hash of the new block.  This prevents anyone from going back and changing a transaction -- even if it were one transaction thousands of blocks back -- because when the new block is hashed, the slight change would cause that hash to look entirely different than the hash of the legitimate blocks. This means that any attempt to alter the network is **immediately detectable and will be rejected** by other people using the network who have the hash of the true transaction history.

## 2.5 What is public key cryptography? How do digital signatures enable peer-to-peer value transfer?

[<img width="667" alt="screen shot 2018-07-16 at 17 29 28" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18194034/42784813-57001d7c-891e-11e8-9d76-5cd4c26378d5.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOW9i4cd-Qk)


#### 2.5.1 Trusted Third Party
Traditional computer networks use what is known as a **client/server architecture**.  **The clients** are the individual computers that access the network.  **The servers** are the computers which host the data that is accessed by the client computers. 

In networks where valuable data such as money or sensitive personal information is transferred, the use of [trusted third parties](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/verif.pdf) is required to relay data between users securely.  These TTPs act as _servers_ that (1) **verify the identities** of the network participants, essentially making sure that users attempting to transfer valuable information cannot send information as someone else, and (2) ensure that the data being communicated is **authentic and trustworthy**. As we mentioned before, banks are a great example of a trusted third party, acting as an enabler of transactions between its clients.

However, in peer-to-peer networks the need for TTP‚Äôs is replaced by the clever use of cryptographic technologies, one of them being public key cryptography.  Digital signature schemes are an application of public key cryptography that allow for anonymous actors to verify each others‚Äô identities without the need for TTPs. 

### 2.5.2 Digital Signatures

[Digital signature schemes](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf) are one of the applications of the public-key cryptography method proposed by Dr. Hellman. This method enables two parties to exchange encrypted messages and verify each other's identities without needing to communicate or share the key required to decrypt the message. It's one of the underlying technologies of blockchains that allow users to circumvent the need for TTPs (trusted third parties) to verify the identity and authenticity of their messages in computer networks - meaning that the receiver knows both who the message came from, and that the information is directly coming from the sender and has not been tampered with. 

**Here's how it works:**  

An algorithm generates two keys. One key is a **private key**, which as the name suggests, should always be kept private. The other is a **public key** which can be made publicly available for all to see. 

The two keys are mathematically linked to each other. This means **everything that is encrypted with your public key, can only be decrypted with your private key. And everything that is encrypted with your private key can only be decrypted with your public key.** This allows you to both **encrypt** and **sign** messages.

When **encrypting**, you use the recipient's public key to encrypt a message, so you can be assured that only he can read it because only he has the private key that will allow him to decrypt it.

When **signing**, you use your private key to encrypt your message's signature. This way, anyone can use your public key to verify that that signature came from you, because your public key could only decrypt a signature that was made with your private key.   

How is this employed in bitcoin? You use your private key to sign/send transactions, and they are addressed to someone‚Äôs public key -- or more precisely an address derived from it. You can know who sent you a transaction too, because the transaction will be signed with the sender‚Äôs private key which is mixed together with the hash of the transaction. This means that the recipient does not end up with the sender‚Äôs private key undercutting the sender‚Äôs privacy because the private key is now combined with a transaction hash that is specific to that particular transaction, and verifiable with the sender‚Äôs address/public key.

## 2.6 How do all of these pieces of technology combine to create a peer-to-peer network that solves the double-spend dilemma? 

[<img width="674" alt="screen shot 2018-07-16 at 17 28 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18194034/42785243-c7719e4a-891f-11e8-9dd5-2f19996ea812.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh3tSHLb-2E)
 
### ‚ÄúDigital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.‚Äù
Satoshi Nakamoto | *Excerpt from Bitcoin Whitepaper*

Hashes and asymmetric cryptography provide two crucial elements for building the bitcoin network, but in order to understand how Satoshi Nakamoto solved the challenge of creating a peer-to-peer network where value can be shared we will next turn our attention to **nodes** and the **protocol** [they use](http://lopp.net/pdf/Bitcoin_Developer_Reference.pdf) to secure the bitcoin blockchain.

### 2.6.1 Nodes

In the context of a blockchain, **nodes** are computers running software that maintains the bitcoin network. Anyone can download the software and become a node if they so choose. Basically, instead of having employees looking into the transactions as banks do, the Bitcoin blockchain lets nodes perform those tasks. Nodes are responsible for storing a shared ledger of the network's entire transaction history and maintaining the integrity of the network. The nodes run special algorithms, we‚Äôll call them the ‚Äú**bookkeeping software**‚Äù, that periodically check transaction pools - meaning all of the transactions submitted by network participants within a specific timeframe - to make sure they are congruent with the history of all previous transactions. In this way, these nodes are able to keep the inegrity of the network without relying on trusted third parties.  

If this seems a little incomprehensible an example might clarify it. In a football game each player knows what the score is at any one time because they all have the ability to look up at the scoreboard and see it. No one could change the score without convincing a majority of the players that there was a good reason to, or literally overwhelming them with force -- like tackling the scorekeeper and anyone who tried to stop you -- until you could change it. Applying this example to the bitcoin network, the ledger is the scoreboard, and the nodes are the players. They can observe every play (transaction), or at least their software can, and so no individual player can secretly change the ledger because they are all watching the transactions come in and storing their own record of them.

![understanding-private-blockchains-7-638](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40152411/42729046-89626670-8780-11e8-992b-00f3f74717fc.jpg)

### 2.6.2 Protocol
The ‚Äúbookkeeping software‚Äù can more accurately be called the **protocol**.The protocol is a set of rules and requirements that standardize the transactions contained in each block in order to maintain the integrity and functionality of the blockchain - it is what actually prevents double spending. It provides the rules for inter-node communication and the validation of new blocks.  There is no need to fully understand the protocol, but just for clarity here is an example of some of the rules of the protocol for validating nodes:
1) Check syntactic correctness of each block
2) Reject if we have duplicate of block in any of the three block categories
3) Transaction list must be non-empty

All the nodes mentioned above are running software that automatically checks if a block of transactions matches these rules. If it does, the nodes accept that block as valid, if it doesn't, then the nodes reject it.

The network is made up of nodes who are following this protocol, but there are different types of nodes. Partial nodes, which have downloaded a part of the ledger, full nodes, which have downloaded the entire ledger, and full nodes that are also miners, meaning that they are actively submitting blocks of transactions to the ledger for other nodes to examine. Since miners do this extra process of bundling, hashing, and submitting transactions, they need an extra incentive on top of just being able to see first hand a secure ledger of their transactions. They need an incentive for behaving honestly so that they keep the ledger's integrity. This incentive comes through a process known as **Proof of Work**. It provides a reward system which makes any attempts at double-spending economically and computationally costy. 

The protocol is being applied by all nodes, but it is miners who package together transactions and submit them to the network so that other nodes can examine them. By participating in this process miners have a chance of winning bitcoin as a reward. The miners then have another incentive to only submit valid transactions because their bitcoin reward will only be valuable so long as the bitcoin network itself is secure. This creates a financial incentive to maintain the network's integrity, and the process has been working well in this decentralized, uncoordinated manner for the past decade with nodes all over the world working to ensure the integrity of the transactions. 


### 2.6.4 How does mining work?

About every 10 minutes a new block is composed, with all the network transactions from the previous 10 minutes contained within. The big question here is, of all the miners, who gets to be the one to mathematically compose this new block and link the next block to the chain and earn some Bitcoin? 


In order to decide that, the system creates a challenge for all the miners to solve. Whoever solves it first gets the right to validate if the transactions from the past 10 minutes are in accordance with the protocol and to attach them to the blockchain -- and to earn some Bitcoins in the form of a reward and all of the transaction fees associated with the transactions in that block!

This challenge is based on a hash function. Currently the one that is utilized is called **SHA-256**. ‚ÄúSHA‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúSecure Hash Algorithm.‚Äù The SHA-256 hash function transforms a piece of input, let's say the message 

###### 'Hello'

and adds numbers to the end of the input, or **base string**, which can be:

###### 'Hello1' or 'Hello2' etc.

...so that when that message is hashed, the resulting hash starts with four 0s. 

Here is an example of a hash created by SHA256:

###### 0000c3af42fc31103f1fdc0151fa747ff87349a4714df7cc52ea464e12dcd4e9

The challenge is to find out what are those numbers that, when added to the end of the base string, will result in the hash *starting with four zeros.* 

When we hear that computers are ‚Äúmining bitcoin‚Äù, what that actually means is that they are essentially solving a big guess and check problem. The software they are running is trying, randomly, by trial and error, to find what numbers were added to the input in order to originate that hash. They keep trying all possibilities until they find the right one and the first to do it gets to validate the next block.
![what-makes-a-blockchain-protocols-and-the-future](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40152411/41691617-558679fa-74b0-11e8-887c-bd4e7d96d17f.gif =500x350)

Any computer can compute more than 4,000 trials per second, so as the number of computers competing for the right to validate a block increases, the system adjusts the difficulty of the challenge so that it corresponds to the current computational power available. It does this by simply adding more leading zeros. This ensures that new blocks are always "mined" every ten minutes. This is why the process is called Proof of Work: in order to mine Bitcoin, computational processing work is involved.  Attaching a computational cost makes submitting false transactions uneconomical because then you would have to overpower the network in order to have the right to validate the next block and submit your false transactions in it. 

**Anyone can become a miner,** and this fits in with the democratic nature of bitcoin. All you need is a computer with sufficient processing power and enough energy to run it, but if you had these resources you could start up a node today and begin competing to validate a block and receive the mining and transaction fee rewards. Some people create mining pools, where multiple miners join together. This means they are likely to receive a mining reward more often because of their greater computing power, but this also means the reward will be smaller as it will be split between them.


When PoW is combined with the protocol and digital signature scheme, double spending is effectively eliminated as a potential threat. This This gets us back to the reason we are learning about bitcoin -- because the nodes are located around the world, and no single node or group of nodes is more important than another, the network cannot be easily shut down making it **censorship resistant**. The bitcoin network involves thousands of nodes to verify transactions against the protocol, as well as miners with a strong financial incentive to maintain the integrity of the network so that their block rewards are made up of a valuable token. These components create a secure, distributed, and censorship resistant network that has no need of centralized intermediaries.
