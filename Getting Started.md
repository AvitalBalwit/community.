# Getting Started

Congratulations! You are now an Ambassador for Democracy Earth Foundation. Here's the basic map pointing you to all the information you will need regarding how to move forward:

* You have received your democracy.earth e-mail and your invite to Basecamp. Now, create your Basecamp profile so we can send you your Ambassador kit and add you to the Ambassadors messaging group. [Here's a video showing how to do it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qCzCuGURqSexr4np_23CvXoEDIeI9IN/view?usp=sharing)
* If you are going to host an event or participate in an event in any form, add it to Basecamp's schedule with all relevant information (ex: streaming link) so that we can add it to our communications. You can ask us questions on the event thread, and Sandra Miller, the responsible for DEF's communications, might be asking you questions over there as well. All events related communication should be made on Basecamp. Here's a video showing how to do it.
