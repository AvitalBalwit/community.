## Democracy Earth Ambassadors Program ðŸŒ¿
# Getting Started

Here you will be able to find all the information you need in order to conduct your activities as an Ambassador for Democracy Earth Foundation.

* **Choose your URL:** On the internet, a URL is analogous to territory. The URL - your Democracy Earth Internet territory -  is where you will build your movement. There are three different kinds of URLs that can be created:  


      1. NATIONAL - A national url points to all posts made by users from a given nation. 
      Ex: venezuela.democracy.earth. Voters self-select nationaity during sign up.

      2. PRIVATE - A private url points to all posts made from a specific account, which 
      you create. Though this gives you full control over the content, it is not interactive; 
      voters can only vote on, or debate, what your post from the account you created -  
      they can't make posts themselves.  

      3. HASHTAG - You can also have a URL pointing to a specific hashtag, Any post made by any
      voter with this hashtab will always be viewable at this URL.   

* **initial set-up:** You have received your democracy.earth e-mail and your invite to Basecamp. Now, create your Basecamp profile with: address, e-mail, phone number, and the URL you will be working on (ex: venezuela.democracy.earth) + 10 questions to kickstart the URL with content. [Here's a video showing how to do it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Pxvgiks7Wbcr2n04XdyGIL1TGj19ZQI/view?usp=sharing) Alternativelly, you can request your URL directly [here](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign/issues/305), on Github.

* **events:** If you are going to host an event or participate in an event in any form, add it to Basecamp's schedule with all relevant information (ex: streaming link) so that we can add it to our communications. You can ask us questions on the event thread, and Sandra Miller, the responsible for DEF's communications, might be asking you questions over there as well. All events related communication should be made on Basecamp. [Here's a video showing how to do it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T0wtDWSeZfLomv_ttJBCJHaLMTP3mdCi/view?usp=sharing)

* **giving a presentation:** Whenever you have a presentation to give, please refer to our [Presentation file](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Presentations.md), where you will find our slides to be downloaded and guidelines regarding how you can edit them. Note that all presentations must be sent to sandra@democracy.earth and paula@democracy.earth at least 72 hours in advance of the event, for approval. Only presentations that are in accordance with the guidelines will be approved.

* **keeping track of our development:** The simplest way to follow our development is by keeping up with our monthly [Development Updates](https://words.democracy.earth/monthly-dev-update/home) at our Hacktivism publication. For a closer look, you can check our [development Milestones](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign/milestones) and see what is being worked on in real time!

* **suggesting a feature:** If you have a suggestion regarding product features, the first step is to make it via the product itself, on [vote.democracy.earth](https://vote.democracy.earth/), and see if the other users like the idea. Be prepared for a good debate! You can also make it via [Github issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign/issues). Every new feature is the product of open, transparent debates, so that the product is very well though through. Here is [an example of a feature proposal](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign/issues/289), and [here is how to create a Github issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=47&v=jcx6wN8neAM)!
