## Democracy Earth Foundation
# Partner Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy (Required)

All Democracy Earth Foundation events including staff, presenters, and attendees are held to a Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy  (github link here) 

We expect that any DEF Ambassador, community member or partner using the Democracy Earth Foundation brand, resources and/or receiving funding from Democracy Earth Foundation offer a Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy to their members and event participants.

To do so:

1. Fork the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy at (github link here) 

2. Update the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy with relevant contact information for your group. 

3. Note: It is very important that the contact information on the Anti-Harassment Policy is up-to-date and actionable for anyone wishing to report harassment. 

4. The point of contact should be an Ambassador, Democracy Earth core team member, and/or the organizer of the event.

5. Publish the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy on your Ambassador website, Meetup page, GitHub account, Google Group, and any other forum for your Ambassador activities.

6. Publish the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy on the registration page for all Democracy Earth Foundation events you hold as an Ambassador, including weekly/monthly meetups.

7. Explicitly, proactively reference the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy in emails to your community members and event attendees.
For example: “Democracy Earth Singapore presenters and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, which you can find at [link].”
