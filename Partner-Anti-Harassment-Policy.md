## Democracy Earth Foundation
# Partner Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy (Required)

All Democracy Earth Foundation events including staff, presenters, and attendees are held to a Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy  (github link here) 

We expect that any DEF Ambassador, community member or partner using the Democracy Earth Foundation brand, resources and/or receiving funding from Democracy Earth Foundation offer a Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy to their members and event participants.

To do so:

1. Fork the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZIkQL2zqLdxFxm4EvCXWthq8-ua5dxk6LrRQhKoAjE/edit#">see this guide</a>.
here.

2. Update the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy with relevant contact information for your group. 

3. Note: It is very important that the contact information on the Anti-Harassment Policy is up-to-date and actionable for anyone wishing to report harassment. 

4. The point of contact should be an Ambassador, Democracy Earth core team member, and/or the organizer of the event.

5. Publish the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy on your Ambassador website, Meetup page, GitHub account, Google Group, and any other forum for your Ambassador activities.

6. Publish the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy on the registration page for all Democracy Earth Foundation events you hold as an Ambassador, including weekly/monthly meetups.

7. Explicitly, proactively reference the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy in emails to your community members and event attendees.  For example: “Democracy Earth Singapore presenters and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, which you can find at In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Democracy Earth Foundation will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, <a href="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md">see this guide</a>.”
