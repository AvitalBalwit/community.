# How to contribute
In keeping with Democracy Earth's open source values, we see the DEF Ambassador Program as a dynamic and collaborative endeavor between the Foundation and its vibrant, active, global community.  We welcome guidance, suggestions and criticism and want to be sure all voices in the building of a global democracy are heard.

## 2 ways to share your feedback and contributions to the Ambassador program: 


**1. [Issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/issues)**

In  general  you will use the issues feature to make comments, raise your concerns, ask a question, request more details/explanation on process or concepts.

We will do our best to answer as fast as possible all issues created by the community.

If you are not familiar with Github, look up the [Github user guide to create an issue.]( https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)


**2. [Pull requests](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ambassadors/pulls)**

Use pull requests to suggest modifications to any Ambassador files - correct typos, grammar, syntax, add clarifying examples, suggest helpful links. A few guidelines for pull request creation:

- Make your edits following the wiki markup language [Mediawiki Formatting](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting/en), they will be easier to merge that way.
- Important: suggest **only one change** per pull request
- Give your pull request a subject/title that clearly and succinctly describes the edit being suggested

We will do our best to address pull requests created by the community as quickly as possible. If the modification is a "no brainer" for reviewers we will merge it instantly, if not we will engage in a conversation with its creators to understand how best we can make use of his/her suggestions or explain why we are rejecting it.

If you are not familiar with Github [look up the Github user guide to create pull requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
